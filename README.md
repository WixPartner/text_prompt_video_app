# Introduction

Styled like LTX-Video is the first DiT-based video generation model that can generate high-quality videos in *real-time*. It can generate 24 FPS videos at 768x512 resolution, faster than it takes to watch the video.

The model supports text-to-image, image-to-video, keyframe-based animation, video extension (both forward and backward), video-to-video transformations, and any combination of these features. This flexibility allows for innovative applications and creative possibilities.
